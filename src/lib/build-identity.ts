/**
 * Build identity: which ccmux CODE a process is running.
 *
 * The daemon is a long-lived background process, so after an upgrade (a new
 * package version, a `bun run build`, a reinstall) it keeps running the old
 * code while every CLI command connects to it (issue #163). Each process
 * computes its own identity at module load, the daemon publishes it on
 * `GET /server-info`, and the CLI's auto-start path (`reconcileDaemon` in
 * `commands/shared.ts`) compares the two and replaces an outdated daemon when
 * it is idle.
 *
 * Three fields, compared in this order by `classifyDaemonBuild`:
 *
 * 1. `version` (package.json). A *strictly older* daemon version -> `outdated`.
 *    Checked FIRST because a version bump is the one signal that is true
 *    across checkouts: a daemon from an older release should be replaced by
 *    any newer CLI, wherever the newer CLI lives. A *newer* daemon than this
 *    CLI is `foreign` (kept): an older CLI must not evict a newer daemon, or
 *    two versions flip-flop the shared process on every command.
 * 2. `artifact`: what was installed. For a compiled binary its realpath; for
 *    `bun <script>` the CHECKOUT ROOT (two levels above the script, so
 *    `dist/index.js` and `src/index.ts` of one checkout share an artifact
 *    while a sibling worktree does not). Same version but a different
 *    artifact -> `foreign`, and foreign is deliberately left alone: two
 *    worktrees on the same version each running the CLI would otherwise
 *    flip-flop the single shared daemon on every command. The user chooses a
 *    build explicitly with `ccmux daemon restart`.
 * 3. `stamp`: size and mtime of the executed file, with the built attention
 *    launcher using `dist/index.js` to identify the daemon it launches.
 *    Same artifact, different stamp -> `outdated` (a rebuild or reinstall in place).
 *
 * A daemon that reports no identity at all (it predates this module) or a
 * malformed one is `outdated`: the issue's rule is that a missing identity is
 * a mismatch, so such a daemon is replaced once, even from another checkout.
 *
 * One verdict is not acted on: `isTransientSourceRun` marks a CLI that is
 * running a checkout's SOURCE while that checkout also holds a built bundle.
 * There, `bin/ccmux` is already rebuilding and the next launch runs the
 * bundle, so an outdated daemon is left alone rather than replaced twice for
 * one edit. See that function for the full reason.
 *
 * `BUILD_IDENTITY` is computed at MODULE LOAD, not on demand. `bin/ccmux`
 * cds into the package root and execs `bun dist/index.js`, so `argv[1]` is
 * RELATIVE; the daemon later does `process.chdir("/")` and the sidebar and
 * spawn commands chdir to `CCMUX_CALLER_PWD`. Resolving lazily after any of
 * those would stat the wrong file (or nothing). Import phase runs before any
 * command action, so the value is right for both the CLI and the daemon.

 * `bin/ccmux` runs the bundle when it is current and otherwise runs
 * `src/index.ts` while kicking off a background `bun run build`. So a single
 * edit under `src/` produces two CLI runs with two different stamps: this
 * source one, then a dist one once the rebuild lands. Letting the source run
 * evict the daemon costs a restart that the very next launch immediately
 * undoes, which is two daemon restarts (and two dropped SSE fleets) per edit
 * instead of one. The source run therefore DEFERS: the rebuild is already in
 * flight, and the dist run that follows does the single correct replacement.
 *
 * The predicate is deliberately about the executed file, not about the build
 * lock: `bin/ccmux`'s one-minute stamp guard means the lock is usually gone
 * while the source run is still the thing executing.
 *
 * Computed at MODULE LOAD for the same reason as `BUILD_IDENTITY` (see the
 * header): `argv[1]` is relative and the process chdirs later.
