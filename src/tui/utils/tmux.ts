 * command's, no interactive shell init can swallow input, and a failed
 * command closes the window instead of leaving a bare shell behind. That
 * keeps the name-based dedupe honest: `new-window -n` pins the name with
 * automatic-rename off, so a lingering shell would otherwise keep the name
 * and the next launch would switch to that dead shell instead of
 * relaunching. The paneless analog of pane click-through for
 * `trackingMode:"background"` rows.
 *
 * Every `switch-client` here names its client with `-c`, from the same
 * resolver `switchToPane` uses. A bare `switch-client` falls through to tmux's
 * `cmd_find_best_client`, which returns the most-recently-active client of any
 * session, and a popup's own keystrokes never advance its client's activity
 * time: with two clients attached, one keypress on the other one is enough to
 * make a bare switch yank a terminal the user never touched. A switch tmux
 * REFUSES reports `clientSwitched: false` with its reason, never a jump that
 * did not happen.
 *
 * What the resolver answers decides the whole shape of the launch, so it runs
 * FIRST, before the dedupe listing and before anything is created:
 *  - A tty, captured or guessed: the window is placed in that client's session
 *    and the pinned switch moves it.
 *  - A malformed capture, a popup whose session has several clients attached,
 *    or a popup whose client could not be worked out: REFUSE with `ok: false`
 *    and create nothing. All three mean we cannot name the terminal to act on
 *    while one exists, and an untargeted window plus an unpinned switch is
 *    exactly the cross-session yank this path exists to remove. A toast the
 *    user can act on beats a silent fallback.
 *  - No client at all (nothing captured, tmux names none): open the window
 *    untargeted and move NOBODY, reporting `no-client-tty`. There is no client
 *    to misplace it relative to, and none to move into it.
 *
 * The `new-window` is `-d` and targeted at the resolved client's session.
 * Left to itself tmux picks the most-recently-active session, which inside a
 * popup is whichever terminal typed last: without `-d` that client's view
 * jumps to a window it never asked for, and without `-t` the window is born in
 * that client's session, so our own switch lands us inside it. Targeted and
 * detached, nothing moves until the pinned `switch-client` runs, and a bare
 * pane id there selects the session, window and pane together.
 * `resolveTmuxClientSessionId` supplies that target, and its doc comment covers
 * why the session has to be read off an untargeted `list-clients`. When it
 * cannot answer for a tty we DID resolve, the launch refuses and creates
 * nothing, for the same reason as above.
